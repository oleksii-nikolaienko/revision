!!! important !!! We just upgrate champ.DMR() function, since now champ.DMP() could works on multiple phenotypes, but ProbeLasso can only works on one DMP result, so if your pheno parameter contains more than 2 phenotypes, and you want to use ProbeLasso function, you MUST specify compare.group=c("A","B"). Bumphunter and DMRcate should not be influenced.

!!! Important !!! New Modification has been made on champ.DMP(): 

    (1): In this version champ.DMP() if your pheno parameter contains more than two groups of phenotypes, champ.DMP() would do pairewise differential methylated analysis between each pair of them. But you can also specify compare.group to only do comparasion between any two of them.

    (2): champ.DMP() now support numeric as pheno, and will do linear regression on them. So covariates like age could be inputted in this function. You need to make sure your inputted "pheno" parameter is "numeric" type.
